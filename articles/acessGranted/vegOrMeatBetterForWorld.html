            <h3>What's the age old question's answer?</h3>
            <p>Vegitarians and Vegans randomly argue with people (who are minding their business) everyday, that eating a diet without meat is not only better for them, but also better for the enviroment and the happiness of the animal, as they have feelings too. The main topic we will be focusing on "Is a non-meat diet better for the enviroment then a meat diet, and is the future even going to have a meat diet?"</p>
            <p>
                Lets take a step back and ask, what goes into a single steak, or a carrot in the store. Based on research published to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622043542#:~:text=meat%2Dbased%20versions.-,On%20average%2C%20meat%2Dbased%20meals%20had%2014%20times%20higher%20environmental%20impact%2C%20while%20vegetarian%20meals%20had%203%20times%20higher%20environmental%20impact%20than%20vegan%20meals.,-Substantial%20reductions%20in">Sciencedirect</a>, a meat meal had a 14 times of an impact to the enviroment, while a vegitarian meal having only 3 times the impact to the enviroment. These two meals were compared with the Vegan meal. 
                Further in the article written by sciencedirect, they state that 80% of all agricultural land is used by meat farming, or crop farming for animals (This is from one single source).<br><br>
                The United Nations wrote a report titled "<a href="https://www.pig333.com/latest_swine_news/global-trends-in-meat-consumption-and-plant-alternatives_19221/">Climate Risks in the Agriculture Sector</a>", published on the Pig333 website, says that global meat consumption will go up by 14% by 2030 compared to 2018 and 2020. Because of consumer choices and population growth, predicted meat eating in richer places would not be as high. The Pig333 document on the UN's article includes that by 2030, chicken will be 41% of all meat products, with beef being 20%. Another section in the article states that by 2030, the feeding and killing of cows for beef is going to increase by 5.8% compared to 2018–2020.<br><br>
                Throughout history, the increase of vegetarian people has been associated with religions that respect all living beings and adopt nonviolence principles, such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism, the Hare Krishna movement, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In addition, in the 20th & 21st centuries, science has observed several health benefits potentially associated with the reduction in meat consumption. Such benefits have strengthened the practice of vegetarianism around the world, and attracted more and more followers.
                Currently, the worldwide prevalence of vegetarianism is not uniform. Asia is the continent with the highest prevalence, with 19 percent of the population adopting this practice.
