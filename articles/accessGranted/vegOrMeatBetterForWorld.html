            <h3 id="articlePart1">What's the age old question's answer?</h3>
            <p>Vegitarians and Vegans randomly argue with people (who are minding their business) everyday, that eating a diet without meat is not only better for them, but also better for the enviroment and the happiness of the animal, as they have feelings too. The main topic we will be focusing on "Is a non-meat diet better for the enviroment then a meat diet, and is the future even going to have a meat diet?"</p>
            <p>
                Lets take a step back and ask, what goes into a single steak, or a carrot in the store. Based on research published to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622043542#:~:text=meat%2Dbased%20versions.-,On%20average%2C%20meat%2Dbased%20meals%20had%2014%20times%20higher%20environmental%20impact%2C%20while%20vegetarian%20meals%20had%203%20times%20higher%20environmental%20impact%20than%20vegan%20meals.,-Substantial%20reductions%20in">Sciencedirect</a>, a meat meal had a 14 times of an impact to the enviroment, while a vegitarian meal having only 3 times the impact to the enviroment. These two meals were compared with the Vegan meal. 
                Further in the article written by sciencedirect, they state that 80% of all agricultural land is used by meat farming, or crop farming for animals (This is from one single source).<br><br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="articlePart2">Current State of Affairs.</h3>
            <p>
                The United Nations wrote a report titled "<a href="https://www.pig333.com/latest_swine_news/global-trends-in-meat-consumption-and-plant-alternatives_19221/">Climate Risks in the Agriculture Sector</a>", published on the Pig333 website, says that global meat consumption will go up by 14% by 2030 compared to 2018 and 2020. Because of consumer choices and population growth, predicted meat eating in richer places would not be as high. The Pig333 document on the UN's article includes that by 2030, chicken will be 41% of all meat products, with beef being 20%. Another section in the article states that by 2030, the feeding and killing of cows for beef is going to increase by 5.8% compared to 2018–2020.<br><br>
                People also become vegitarian because of their religion. Religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism, the Hare Krishna movement, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church do not eat certain types to no meat. In the 20th & 21st centuries, it has been observed that there are many health benefits that can be linked to the reduction in meat consumption. These benefits have strengthened the practice of vegetarianism.
                The country with the most vegitarians is India. This was taken from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-highest-rates-vegetarians-174109766.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANSeUjyxqmRZpmllrZhNPUmetHDj16b0wTuctWlViMr25Uqwxwa0ab1_ahZt9LrRfv2Rn6kdvHRFnlxovLe3NfTIENp4RptkqjTZlFYNjM8FRmPbQjGAdOpben0TXhXhiAUou7DzbzSvR609Ge7srKb7MIrQyyqalptAWwCtR9dn#:~:text=India%20leads%20the%20countries%20with,Organization%20of%20the%20United%20Nations.">Yahoo Finance</a>.

            <br>
            <h3 id="articlePart3">Benefits & Concerns of a non-meat diet.</h3>
            <p>
                There are many benefits to be eating a non-meat diet. One of the benefits is that is reduces Green-House-Emissions. It is believed that 30% of of all comissions are caused by food production. Meat production is more than two times more polluting than a non-meat diet food production of fruits and veggies. Research predicts that if people were to change to a non-meat diet today, that pollution would decrease by 49%. In addition, non-meat diets save more water than a meat diet. To produce 1kg of plant based food would use 23% less water that 1kg of beef. The meat industry uses 24% of the fress water on this planet. Not to mention that the there the whole earth has about 3% of fresh water.
                <br>But along side the benefits, there are concerns to these types of diets. One major issue is that Vegans can be at a greater risk of anaemic (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=anaemic&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#:~:text=A%20condition%20in%20which%20the%20blood%20doesn%27t%20have%20enough%20healthy%20red%20blood%20cells.">More Info Here</a>). This health condition is caused by the lack of B12 and Omega 3. The effects of the health condition include fatigue and lack of concentration in younger people. It is also believed that there is a link between veganism and lower bone density (<a href="https://theconversation.com/is-veganuary-bad-for-you-a-nutritionist-explains-why-plant-based-diets-need-proper-planning-196980#:~:text=Vegans%20can%20be,risk%20of%20fractures.">Source</a>). Poorly planed vegan diets will cause a lack of calcium, Vitamin D, B2, Iodine, Zinc and so on. Thats why if you want to have a vegan diet, you should very carefully plan it out.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="articlePart4">The Future.</h3>
            <p>
                If people did change to plant based diets, research shows that the pollution will reduce by 75%. Due to the large impact of meat eating, in places that are richer than others, meat eating will reduce down in the future as people are forced to not eat meat. TED have made videos abot how bugs will be the future. I, the writer of this article, do also believe that our future will include bugs in our diets. But will bugs be a small part of our diets, or will it be a major part of it. Would bugs add or even replace meat in meals, or will bugs be out of the picture and people just switch to a plant based diet.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="articlePart5">Summary.</h3>
            <p>
                While most current research done shows that non-meat diets reduce pollution by 75%, Piers Morgan did argue a good factor on how the planes had to bring vegans food halfway accross America to vegans tofu diners (View full clip here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8q5WVCTXkk">[7 Minute Video]</a>). And if Piers can just sit there and argue about the bees and the planes, while eating a BigMac, surely he has a point. Because of vegan activists that take it to extreme, no one wants to switch from meat to vegan (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d7s-aoypoo">Another Piers Morgan Clip [11 Minutes]</a>). So is there more benefits to eating vegan foods than meat foods?
