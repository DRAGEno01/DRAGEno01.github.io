On this GitHub website, you can view anything that I uploaded, because... well... I wanted to publish content.

A few of the projects that can be found are:

## [Online Notepad](https://drageno01.github.io/?notepad)
A free online notepad that allows you to download the file you have been working on. The only difference is that you can customize your expirence by customizing the colors.

## [DRAGE Chat](https://drageno01.github.io/?chat)
A free chat platform that allows people to communicate in one big chat room. Currently being updated and moderated.

## AdersonMDT
Made for fun for a roleplay game, but the people were racist so I removed their login.

## [Minecraft Club Website](https://drageno01.github.io/?mcc)
Built for the love of Minecraft. Used to show information about what will be happening in the upcoming weeks. No longer being supported or updated.

## School IT Website.
A school hired me and wanted me to build a very simple website to promote their IT department. They wanted nothing too fancy. Just to make it seem like a student made it.
